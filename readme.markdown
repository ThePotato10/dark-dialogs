So I forgot the email and password I used to sign up for the NPM account where I published this, and so no further updats will be provided. My bad y'all

# dark-dialogs
A fork of https://github.com/JamesKyburz/dialogs but with a dark twist

The JavaScript and 95% of the CSS is exactly the same as you would find in the original version. No functionality was changed, only the cosmetic css layer
